	<h1>What is the objective of your website?</h1>	
	<p>
		The project objective will be to demonstrate the design of a website that provides data about Babson's Math Resource Center.
		The website will include the MRC schedule for the week as well as more information about the different consultants. 
		Additionally, there will be quick FAQs about AQM (ie. basic commands and how-tos in R, excel, and MiniTab). The goal of my website
		is to make the MRC more accessible by providing more information about it.

	<h1>Who is the target audience for your website?</h1>

		My website is to help babson students who are taking AQM1000 or AQM2000 utilize the MRC center more and get better help.
